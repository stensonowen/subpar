#### accessibility dashboard for nyc subway

### Why

Accessibility as a first-class concern improves the user experience for everyone. The MTA is gradually improving on this front.

One of the most important improvements they've made is exposing data feeds for train and station status, allowing us to build our own platform.

### Data Sources

* [Subway Entrances](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Entrances-and-Exits-2024/i9wp-a4ja/about_data)
* [Stations & Complexes](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Stations-and-Complexes/5f5g-n3cz/about_data)
